**Overview:**

Following the tutorial laid out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM and here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QILNlRvJlfQ I followed the examples, created the 
same queries and the same dashboard as the tutorial. After completing I also further analyzed the significance that low income/poverty has on the infection and death
rates of COVID-19.

I found there was a slight correlation between low GDP per a capita and the infection rate of COVID-19

**New Tools/Things Learned!:**

This is my first time using Tableau! I am sure that I can unlock more of the app's potential. I also used a with statement for the first time in SQL.
